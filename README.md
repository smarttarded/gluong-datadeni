  Current Bugs:
    -encrypting a folder with a subfolder will actually encrypt all files within the subfolder, or the subfolder of that subfolder if one exists.

  </h2>
  <div align="center">

    A simple python program that hides folders and encrypts all files within it, capable of:

      a. encrypting any folder on your computer (and reencrypts it if you have an existing key connected)
      b. encrypts any files format within that folder
      c. sends a unique key to a chosen drive
      d. the option to simply hide the folder instead of encrypting it



<p align="center">
    All imported libraries should come pre installed with the standard python installation.

    To run the program, you can:
      a. execute python gluong-datadeni.py
      b. execute python setup.py build and run gluong-datadeni.exe in the build folder
      c. download the zip files in the releases page (current working version 2.0.1)
