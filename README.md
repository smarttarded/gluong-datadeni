  # gluong-datadeni
    a simple python file that hides folders and encrypts all files within it.

    simply bring the datadeni.py file into any directory that contains folders you want to hide and run it. 
    It includes a hidden password database (default: admin) that stores all password keys.

    All imported libraries should come pre installed with the standard python installation.
  
    You can also change the .py file extension to .pyw to hide the terminal at runtime.
