  # gluong-datadeni
    a simple python program that hides folders and encrypts all files within it.

    All imported libraries should come pre installed with the standard python installation.
  
    You can also change the .py file extension to .pyw to hide the terminal at runtime, 
  or compile it into an exe by running python setup.py build in the terminal.
